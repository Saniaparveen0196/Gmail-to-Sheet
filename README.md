Gmail to Google Sheets Automation

A Python automation script that reads unread emails from Gmail and logs them into a Google Sheet using Google APIs. The project uses OAuth 2.0 authentication, prevents duplicate entries, and maintains state across runs.

2️⃣ Setup Instructions (Step-by-Step)

Prerequisites
Python 3.7+
Gmail account
Google Cloud account
Google Sheet

Step 1: Google Cloud Setup

Create a project in Google Cloud Console
Enable:

Gmail API
Google Sheets API
Create OAuth Client ID
Type: Desktop App
Download credentials

Save file as:

credentials/credentials.json
Step 2: Google Sheet Setup

Create a Google Sheet
Copy Spreadsheet ID from URL
Add it to config.py

Step 3: Install Dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

Step 4: Run the Script
python src/main.py

Browser opens for OAuth (first run)
Permissions granted
Emails are logged to the sheet

3️⃣ OAuth Flow Used

Uses OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code Flow
User grants Gmail & Sheets permissions
Access and refresh tokens are stored locally
Tokens are reused on subsequent runs
Why OAuth?
Gmail API requires user-based access
Secure and revocable by the user

4️⃣ Duplicate Prevention Logic

Duplicates are prevented using two methods:

Gmail filter
is:unread in:inbox
Only unread emails are fetched.
State file tracking
File: credentials/state.json
Stores processed Gmail message IDs
Emails already processed are skipped
This ensures the script can be run multiple times safely.

5️⃣ State Persistence Method

Uses a JSON file (state.json)
Stores:
Processed email IDs
Last run timestamp
State is loaded at startup and saved after execution
Why JSON?
Simple
Lightweight
No database required

6️⃣ Challenge Faced & Solution
Challenge: Preventing Duplicate Entries on Multiple Runs

Problem:
When the script was executed multiple times, the same emails could be fetched again, leading to duplicate rows being added to the Google Sheet.

Solution:

Implemented a state persistence mechanism using a local JSON file (state.json)
Each processed Gmail message ID is stored after successful insertion
Before processing an email, the script checks whether the message ID already exists
Additionally, emails are marked as read after processing

Result:

Running the script multiple times does not create duplicate entries
Only new, unread emails are processed
The automation is safe to rerun at any time

7️⃣ Limitations

Works for a single Gmail account
Uses file-based state (not suitable for very large scale)
Basic email body parsing
No rollback if script stops midway

📌 Conclusion

This project demonstrates:

OAuth-based API integration
Gmail automation
Google Sheets logging
Duplicate prevention
Persistent state handling
